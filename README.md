<h3>More info on each one:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Python:</b> I have been using it for 3 years, it's my main language, and I know pretty much everything about it. 🥇</li>
  <li><b>Java:</b> It wasn't the second language I learnt, however it's my second langauge that I use occassionally. However like the others, if I don't have a use for it, i just don't use it. #memory 🥈</li>
  <li><b>C#:</b> This was the second language I learnt, I liked some of it's features and I got good/competent at it. I will surely re-learn it if I do go down into game development. (👀 Hint hint) 🥉</li>
  <li><b>C++:</b> I learnt this language quite a while back and I barely remember it. The reason I put it on here is because I can kind of program in it and I can read it well. I know I will need to learn it in the future (and I am also thinking about learning it now) but I would need a really strong reason to go with c++ (🚀 other than its speed) to use it over python </li>
  <li><b>Lua:</b> This is the one everyone knows but doesn't want to admit they know (same for me). I decided to learn lua just to make what I wanted as an ideal roblox game. Unfortunately whilst I was not lacking in the programming dep<b>art</b>ment, there was another one that I was which denied me possibilities to use it. 🎨</li>
</ul>

<h4> Final note:</h4>
<p>I am an intermediate at programming. I know my basic data structures, some algorithms (all array searches + sorts). I am okay at OOP. I am not some prodigious programmer who is amazing at this. I just simply code as a hobby and make what I like, one day I will be coding as a profession. I am taking this journey very slow, but if you rush it, what journey did you have? </p>
<p>Have a good day 😄 - Alex</p>
